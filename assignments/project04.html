You will use your implementation of sort/find_max_index and merge/merge_sort. The other assembly implementations are given. Your emulator will need the logic (decoding and emulating instructions) and state (arm_state) from lab04 Your emulator will support dynamic analysis of instruction execution.

We are giving you an implementation of a direct mapped cache. In addition to the set associative cache implementation, you will collect the following metrics: Total memory references (refs) Hits (hits) Misses (misses) Cold misses (misses_cold) Hot misses (misses_hot)" />

    <ol>
      <li># of instructions executed (i_count)</li>
      <li># of data processing  and mul instructions executed (dp_count)</li>

      <li># of branches not taken from bCC (b_not_taken)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Your emulator will include an implementation of a 4-way set-associative cache, as is common in commercial processors. We are giving you an implementation of a direct mapped cache. In addition to the set associative cache implementation, you will collect the following metrics:
    <ol>

<h2 id="given">Given</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In lecture and lab, we will:
    <ol>
      <li>illustrate how to decode machine code and execute the operations specified</li>
      <li>illustrate a direct-mapped cache and describe the data structures and algorithms required for a set-associative cache</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>We will provide autograder test cases for the emulation targets</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h2>
<ol>
  <li>80 pts: Automated tests</li>
  <li>10 pts: Interactive Grading, including, but not limited to, your implementation of dynamic analysis and the instruction cache.</li>
  <li>10 pts: Clean repo, consistent naming and indentation, no dead code, no unnecessarily complex code</li>
</ol>
